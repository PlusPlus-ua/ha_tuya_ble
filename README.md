# Home Assistant support for Tuya BLE devices

## Overview

This integration supports Tuya devices connected via BLE.

_Inspired by code of [@redphx](https://github.com/redphx/poc-tuya-ble-fingerbot)_

## Installation

Place the `custom_components` folder in your configuration directory (or add its contents to an existing `custom_components` folder). Alternatively install via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=airy10&repository=ha_tuya_ble&category=integration)

## Usage

After adding to Home Assistant integration should discover all supported Bluetooth devices, or you can add discoverable devices manually.

The integration works locally, but connection to Tuya BLE device requires device ID and encryption key from Tuya IOT cloud. It could be obtained using the same credentials as in official Tuya integration. To obtain the credentials, please refer to official Tuya integration [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tuya/)

## Support project

I am working on this integration in Ukraine. Our country was subjected to brutal aggression by Russia. The war still continues. The capital of Ukraine - Kyiv, where I live, and many other cities and villages are constantly under threat of rocket attacks. Our air defense forces are doing wonders, but they also need support. So if you want to help the development of this integration, donate some money and I will spend it to support our air defense.
